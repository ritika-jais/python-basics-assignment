Advanced Debugging Assignment - Solutions

Overview

This repository contains solutions to the Advanced Debugging assignment. The goal of this assignment is to identify and fix various types of errors, debug complex functions, improve code readability, and optimize performance. Each solution includes comments explaining the fixes.

Challenges and Solutions

1. Error Classification

Syntax Errors: Fixed missing colons and improper indentation.

Runtime Errors: Used try-except blocks to handle division by zero.

Logic Errors: Corrected incorrect formulas for calculations.

2. Debugging Complex Functions

Implemented error handling for invalid input types.

Prevented division by zero errors.

3. Debugging an Intermittent Failure

Removed zero from possible values to prevent division errors.

4. Writing Debug-Friendly Code

Improved readability and added error handling for invalid input formats.

5. Rubber Duck Debugging

Explained the code step-by-step to clarify its execution process.

6. Debugging a Multi-threaded Program

Added a threading lock to prevent race conditions.

7. Debugging with Breakpoints

Included error checks before performing division.

8. Memory Optimization and Performance Debugging

Used list comprehensions to improve efficiency.

9. Unexpected None Return

Ensured that functions explicitly return values.

10. Silent Failures

Explicitly handled exceptions instead of ignoring them.
