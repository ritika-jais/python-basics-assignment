The wind it sings a gentle song,
That drifts through trees and hums along,
It carries dreams on silver wings,
And tells the tale of hidden things.

It dances through the meadow wide,
With secrets only stars confide,
It brushes past with softest grace,
Then disappears without a trace.

So listen close when night is near,
The wind may speak what hearts can't hear,
A lullaby, a voice so kindâ€”
A whisper from the wandering mind.
